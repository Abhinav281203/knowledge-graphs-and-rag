# Knowledge Graphs and RAG

Knowledge graph implementation using Nebula Graph + Retrieval augmented generation.
An example of a knowledge graph is `Dumbledore.html` where we can see the relationships between various entities with `depth=1`, mainly focusing on the character <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore<a> from Harry Potter.

## Talking docs

Utilized a FinetunedTransformer model (Llama2) to implement multi-document summarization, enhancing it with MMR, TextRank, and clustering techniques for redundancy reduction, keyword extraction, and semantic data gathering respectivelyâ€”implemented RAG (retrieval augmented generation) to give the model extra knowledge of documents for interactive conversations.
