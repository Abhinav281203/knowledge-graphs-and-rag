# Knowledge Graphs and RAG

Knowledge graph implementation using Nebula Graph + Retrieval augmented generation

## Talking docs

Utilized a FinetunedTransformer model (Llama2) to implement multi-document summarization, enhancing it with MMR, TextRank, and clustering techniques for redundancy reduction, keyword extraction, and semantic data gathering respectivelyâ€”implemented RAG (retrieval augmented generation) to give the model extra knowledge of documents for interactive conversations.
